If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? 
Would you implement anything differently?
* Filtering/sorting on columns.
* Add and use SCSS instead and clean up/remove inline styling.
* Implement the datagrid/table to be reusable/generic.
* Add validation on API requests and their data.
* Instead of using an alt image link for images that can't load or have no URL, use a generic fallback image of a community to retain consistency.
