If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? 
Would you implement anything differently?
* Filtering/sorting on columns.
* Implement the datagrid/table to be reusable/generic.
* Add and use SCSS instead and clean up/remove inline styling.
* Add validation on API requests and their data.
* Instead of using an alt image link for images that can't load or have no URL, use a generic fallback image of a community to retain consistency.
* Maybe have a placeholder for empty cells or cells that might confuse users as to why they are empty.
* If I were to re-implement this table, I would create a different tab/page/table that the user could view homes only. Since users probably would find a lot of value in viewing homes directly based on their price and/or area, rather than looking at them sorted by communities.
